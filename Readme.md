# Ford Bikeshare dataset

## Overview of the dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset contains 183412 row with 12 columns. It contains data about starting and ending times, trip duration, starting and ending stations, user type, gender, and age.

## Summary of Findings

in the exploration, I was searching for answers regarding the average trip duration, most start times, most start stations, does Age, gender, or user type affect duration.
Average trip duration from histogram lies between 4 to 7 mins. Most start day are within holidays at 4 PM and 8 AM. Most start stations are "Market St at 10th St", followed by "San Francisco Caltrain Station 2 (Townsend St at 4th St)". Average Age of people going a trip between 30 and 35 year. I also found that trip duration increases by increasing age until 35 then it decreases by increasing age. Exploring gender and user type to see their effect on trip duration vs age it seems that they have no effect on them.

## key insights for presentation
I started by introducing the dataset, then started the presentation with questions which are the main focus of the investigation. then answering them by viewing plots.
